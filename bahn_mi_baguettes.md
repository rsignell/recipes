# Bahn Mi Baguettes
Chau's Banh Mi Method

I usually make 3 baguettes with a starting weight of around 145-150gm each.  Post bake they are about 120gm, and around 118 after they cool down.
## Ingredients

* Flour 100% 50/50 blend of Bread Flour (12-13%) /High Gluten Flour (13-16%) (360g)
* Water 67%  (If using 100% HG flour adjust hydration up to 72-73%) (240g)
* Instant Dry Yeast 1% (3.6g)
* Salt 1-2%  (5g)
* Brown sugar 1% (3.6g)
* Vinegar 1% (3.6g)
* Oil 0.5%  (1.8g)

## Instructions
-Dissolve IDY in water, and mix equal amounts of flour to make a poolish.  Cover and rest at RT until doubled to triple.  Use before it collapses though.
-add remaining ingredients except the oil, and mix until the dough is well developed, about 4-5min in a KA mixer on speed 2, or Bosch for about 6min on speed 1.
-add oil at the very end of the mixing period.
-coat hands in oil, ball the dough up, cover and rest until dough has doubled or a bit more.
-remove and reball, this will degass the dough a bit.  Rest the dough for just a few minutes and divided into 150gm portions.
-reball each piece, degassing the big bubbles.
-cover and allow to rest about 10min for the balls to relax.
-flatten each ball with palm, and stretch open as if opening a pizza dough but not that thin.  You want a disk that is about 1/2" thick or so.
-roll it tightly into a cylindrical shape or shape using traditional baguette shaping techniques.
-roll each log out to desired length and place into a baguette pan seam side down.  You may also proof using a baker's couche/linen.
-coat hands with oil and gently pat the tops of the loaves.  This will help them stay moist and prevent drying and sticking.
-cover with another pan, lid, or plastic sheet.  Proof until loaves double.
-Score and load into a hot oven.   Lots of different methods for steaming and baking bread and they all seem to work well.
-bake about 20-25m until desired browness.

Note: yeasted bread in general should finish their expansion during the bake.  When tapped, the baked loaves should have a hollow sound. Bread should feel relatively light in hand compared to the relative volume of the loaf.
