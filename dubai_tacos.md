* 1.25 t (6g) Smoked Paprika
* 1.5 T (20g) Baking Powder

### Taco Sauce
(makes 1 1/4 cups, enough for 8-10 tacos)
* 1/3 cup catsup
* 1/3 cup mayonnaise 
* 2 tablespoons tahini (sesame paste)
* 2 tablespoons lemon juice (fresh preferably)
* 1 tablespoon pomegranate molasses 
* 1 small garlic clove, minced or grated
* 1 teaspoon harissa paste (or sambal oelek, or sriracha, or other hot sauce)
* 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
* 1/2 teaspoon za’atar 
* Salt and black pepper to taste
* 1-2 tablespoons water (to adjust consistency)

## Instructions
### Tacos
1. Pulse the green pepper, onion and jalapenos in a food processor until fine (but not soup!) mix all taco ingredients together with your hands
2. Form into 110g balls, salt to taste just before grilling.
3. Heat cast iron skillet to 425 degrees.  Put ball in pan, top with a 5 inch tortilla and press with a spatula until very thin, reaching the edge of the tortilla (it should be as thin as a smash burger!)
4. When nicely brown, flip and top with white american cheese, then fold and sear both sides until the tortilla is golden brown.
5. Remove from pan and let cool a bit before topping with sauce. 

### Sauce
In a medium bowl, whisk together the catsup, mayonnaise, tahini, lemon juice, olive oil, minced garlic, harissa, cumin, and za’atar.
7. Add salt and black pepper to taste. If the sauce is too thick, add water 1 tablespoon at a time, until it reaches a drizzle-type consistency.
8. Let the sauce sit for 15 minutes to allow flavors to blend. 

9. Can be made up to 5 days in advance, store in airtight container in fridge. Stir before using.
