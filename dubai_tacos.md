* 1 tablespoon flaked salt
* 1/2 teaspoon cardamon powder 
* 3/4 teaspoon nutmeg powder 
* 1.5 teaspoons cinnamon powder
* 1.25 teaspoons Smoked Paprika powder
* 1.5 tablespoons Baking Powder

### Taco Sauce
(makes 1 1/4 cups, enough for 8-10 tacos)
* 1/3 cup catsup
* 1/3 cup mayonnaise 
* 2 tablespoons tahini (sesame paste)
* 2 tablespoons lemon juice (fresh preferably)
* 1 tablespoon pomegranate molasses 
* 1 small garlic clove, minced or grated
* 1 teaspoon harissa paste (or sambal oelek, or sriracha, or other hot sauce)
* 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
* 1/2 teaspoon za’atar 
* Salt and black pepper to taste

## Instructions
### Tacos
1. Pulse the green pepper, onion and jalapenos in a food processor, mix all taco ingredients together with your hands
2. Form into 110g balls
3. Heat cast iron skillet to 425 degrees.   Put ball in pan, top with a 5 inch tortilla and press with a spatula until very thin, reaching the edge of the tortilla (it should be as thin as a smash burger!)
4. After about 30 seconds, top with white american cheese, fold and sear until the tortilla is golden brown, about 30s. Flip to other side and sear it as well.
5. Remove from pan and let cool a bit before topping with sauce. 

### Sauce
In a medium bowl, whisk together the catsup, mayonnaise, tahini, lemon juice, olive oil, minced garlic, harissa, cumin, and za’atar.
7. Add salt and black pepper to taste. If the sauce is too thick, add water 1 tablespoon at a time, until it reaches a drizzle-type consistency.
8. Let the sauce sit for 15 minutes to allow flavors to blend. 

9. Can be made up to 5 days in advance, store in airtight container in fridge. Stir before using.
