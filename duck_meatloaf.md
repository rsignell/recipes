# Duck Meatloaf
## Ingredients
* 1.5 pounds ground duck (can sub 1.5 lbs ground chicken + 3T butter)
* 2 eggs, lightly beaten
* 1 cup panko or other dried breadcrumbs
* 1 cup cooked brown or white rice from about ⅓ cup dry rice
* 3 green onions, chopped plus more for garnish
* 1 celery rib, chopped fine
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 inch ginger, minced

* 2 t soy sauce
* 1 t regular salt
* 1/2 t Chinese five spice powder
* 1/2 t black pepper
* 1/2 t chili paste
* 1 tablespoon neutral vegetable oil for brushing the top of meatloaf

## Directions
* Preheat oven to 400°F.
* Mix all of the ingredients except for the ground duck and vegetable oil
* Gently mix in the ground duck
* Pack the mixture into a meatloaf pan (ideal because the fat drains down) or shape it into a loaf in a cast iron skillet.
* Brush the top with the vegetable oil.
* Bake for about 40 minutes, until the internal temperature is 165°F.
* If using the hoisin glaze, brush the glaze on to the top of the meatloaf, and continue baking for 5 minutes.
* Remove the meatloaf from the oven and let stand for 5 to 10 minutes prior to cutting and serving.
