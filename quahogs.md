Absolutely. Including a note on freshness and safe handling is very important for shellfish recipes.
I have added a prominent safety note to the beginning of the recipe instructions.
Clam-Forward Stuffed Quahogs with Aleppo Chile (Final Recipe)
Yields: 14-16 Stuffed Half-Shells
Prep Time: 20 minutes
Cook Time: 25-30 minutes
⚠️ Safety Note
For best flavor and safety, ensure all clams are cooked within 3 days of harvest and stored properly in a refrigerator until preparation.
Ingredients
Clam & Shells
 * 255\text{ g} (approx. 9\text{ oz}) cooked, chopped quahog meat
 * 14-16 clean, reserved quahog half-shells
Stuffing Base
 * \approx 150\text{ g} (approx. 5.3\text{ oz}) chouriço or linguica sausage, casing removed and finely chopped
 * 2\text{ tablespoons} butter or olive oil
 * 1\text{ large} yellow onion, finely chopped
 * 2\text{ cloves} garlic, minced
 * 1\text{ teaspoon} Aleppo chile flakes
 * 1/4\text{ teaspoon} black pepper
Binder & Liquid
 * 2\text{ cups} dried sourdough breadcrumbs (see Step 2)
 * 1\text{ cup} Reserved Clam Broth (strained) OR Bottled Clam Juice (have extra on hand)
 * 2\text{ tablespoons} fresh parsley, minced
 * Optional: Lemon wedges and hot sauce for serving
Instructions
Phase 1: Prep & Sauté
 * Prepare Broth: If using reserved clam broth, ensure it is carefully strained through cheesecloth or a coffee filter to remove any grit or sand.
 * Prepare Breadcrumbs: Cut \approx 200\text{ g} of sourdough bread into 1\text{-inch} cubes. Spread on a baking sheet and bake in a low oven (200^\circ\text{F} to 250^\circ\text{F}) for 30\text{-}60\text{ minutes} until completely dry and crisp. Let cool, then measure out 2\text{ cups} of crumbs.
 * Sauté Sausage & Onion: In a large skillet over medium heat, melt the butter/oil. Add the chopped onion and sauté until translucent (5\text{-}7\text{ minutes}). Add the 150\text{ g} of sausage and cook, breaking it up, until browned and the fat is rendered.
 * Add Aromatics: Reduce heat slightly. Stir in the minced garlic and Aleppo chile flakes. Cook for 1 minute until fragrant. Remove the pan from heat.
Phase 2: Final Assembly & Texture
 * Process Filling (For Fine Texture): Transfer the cooked sausage, onion, garlic, and clam meat to a food processor (Cuisinart). Pulse several times until the mixture is broken down to your desired fine, cohesive consistency. Do not over-process into a paste.
 * Moisten and Mix: Transfer the processed mixture back to a large bowl. Add the 1\text{ cup} of clam broth/juice and black pepper. Mix well.
 * Add Breadcrumbs: Fold in the 2\text{ cups} of dried sourdough breadcrumbs and fresh parsley. Mix until everything is cohesive.
 * Adjust Consistency (CRITICAL): The mixture should be moist enough to hold its shape firmly when scooped, but not sticky or mushy. Add extra clam broth/juice, 1\text{ tablespoon} at a time, if too dry, or extra breadcrumbs if too wet.
Phase 3: Stuff & Bake
 * Preheat and Stuff: Preheat your oven to 375^\circ\text{F} (190^\circ\text{C}). Spoon the stuffing generously into the reserved half-shells, mounding the mixture high on top.
 * Bake: Place the stuffed shells on a baking sheet and bake for 15\text{-}20\text{ minutes}, or until the tops are golden brown and lightly crispy.
 * Serve: Serve hot with lemon wedges and a dash of your favorite hot sauce.
