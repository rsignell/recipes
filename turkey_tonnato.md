## Turkey Tonnato

Super easy, fast, delicious and healthy version of vitello tonnato.

Serves 2.

In a blender (food processor cant get it as smooth) combine:
* one 6 1/2 oz can drained tuna
* 1/2 cup cooked chickpeas
* 1/4 cup plain yogurt. 

With machine on, drizzle in:
* 1/2 cup olive oil. 

Transfer to bowl and stir in:
* 1/4 cup capers
* 1/2 cup chopped mixed tarragon, dill and chives. 
* Salt and pepper to taste

Serve over 1/8 inch thick slices of roast turkey breast (we just ask the deli to cut slightly thick slices). Great with arugula on the side.

Tip: buy tuna in olive oil, and drain it into a measuring cup to use for part of the 1/2 cup of olive oil!
