# Andrea Nguyen Pickled Veg (for Bahn Mi)
## Ingredients
* 1 pound|454 grams daikon, or 2 (8-ounce|227-gram) purple-top turnips or watermelon radishes
* 1 (6-ounce|171-gram) carrot
* 1 teaspoon fine sea salt
* 2 teaspoons granulated sugar, plus ½ cup (90g)
* 1 ¼ cups (260g) distilled white vinegar (preferably Heinz) 
## Instructions
* Peel and cut the daikon into sticks about 3 inches long and ¼-inch thick (the width of an average chopstick). Peel and cut the carrot into sticks a little skinnier than the daikon.
* Put both vegetables in a bowl and toss with the salt and 2 teaspoons sugar. Massage and knead for 3 minutes, or set aside for 20 minutes, until you can bend a piece of daikon so the tips touch without breaking. They will have lost about a quarter of their original volume.
* Rinse the vegetables with water, drain in a mesh strainer or colander, and press or shake to expel excess water. Transfer to a 4-cup|946-ml jar.
* In a medium bowl, stir together the remaining ½ cup|90g sugar with the vinegar and 1 cup water until dissolved. Pour enough of the liquid into the jar to cover the vegetables, discard any excess, and let sit for 1 hour.
* Use immediately, or refrigerate for up to 1 month.
